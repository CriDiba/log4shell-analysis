## Proof-of-concept: Exploiting Log4j vulnerability
To show how Log4Shell can easily lead an adversary to execute code on a target machine we have created a proof-of-concept that illustrates a typical attack on a web app carried out through this vulnerability.

In this repository we have made and example vulnerable application and proof-of-concept exploit of it.
